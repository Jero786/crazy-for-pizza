# Crazy for Pizza

Simple GraphQL UI client which allow order Pizza with a simple Cart.

#### Tech Stack selected

* Redux: The reactive programming allow us to build more predictible, scalable & Solid web application.
* lodash: For cross browsing suppport, performance and reliable way to handler data. (only for dump component)
* Sass: It's very usefull to use pre-procesor to write a more readeable css and easy to use it.
* BEM/SMACSS: using block element modifier and with some things of SMACSS is a really clean way to style components. Also it's a really a performance way to style component instead use neested selectors. (you don't care any more about not pass to 3 nested level)
* Apollo & Apollo-React: Integration with GraphQL and React & Redux, in order to consume GraphQL API server.

### Missing points

* I didn't able to implement UT for time reason.
* I didn't able to implement pagination for time reason.
* I didn't able to cross-browser for time reason.
